ALWAYS BACKUP FILES BEFORE USING THIS

This requires .NET 10.0. (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0)

This is a quick utility for extracting and inserting tiles into various Ultima games, currently Ultima 1-5 PC versions.  No enhanced or modified versions are currently supported, and this will only use the default tile set.  For example, with Ultima 5, it supports both CGA and EGA, but this currently will only support the EGA tile set.

Usage:

Set the mode of the tiles you want to work with on the left side of the application.
Set the directory of the data files you're using (typically the game location).
Set the directory you want the image files to work with.

Extracting will generate a .png file for you to edit with your preferred image editor.

Stay within the bounds of EGA for Ultima 1, 4, and 5 and CGA for Ultima 2 and 3.
